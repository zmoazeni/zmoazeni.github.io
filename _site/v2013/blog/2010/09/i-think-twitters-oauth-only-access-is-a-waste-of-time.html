    <h1><cite>I think Twitter's OAuth-only Access is a Waste of Time</cite></h1>

    <p>I don’t normally write sensationalist articles, but today I’m going depart from the norm and make a bold claim: I think Twitter’s <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/08/twitter-applications-and-oauth.html">change to OAuth-only authentication</a> is a waste of time for developers and businesses.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think the <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0/">OAuth spec</a> is slick and has very good intentions at it’s core. Nor am I knocking it out of inexperience, as I’ve been building OAuth based applications for the past 6 months. However my primary gripe with Twitter’s OAuth-only stance boils down to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth">xAuth</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you that aren’t familiar with Twitter’s recent change, before September 1st you could access their API by passing across your twitter username and password. This was fine if you were using your own credentials, however the Twitter ecosystem is rather large, and most people who interact with Twitter do it via a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">3rd</a> <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">party</a> <a href="http://cotweet.com/">service</a>. The security issue is handing your password to an untrusted source. As of September 1st however, developers are only allowed to access the API using <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/auth_overview">OAuth</a>, which requires you to give your username and password <em>only</em> to Twitter and then Twitter will authorize the application on your behalf. Even I admit, the protocol is rather elegant. When it comes to Web applications, I can hardly argue the security. The user is already in a browser and being directed to Twitter and back mostly only fires up User Experience guys.</p>

<p>However, I have a huge issue with <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth">xAuth</a>. xAuth is Twitter’s solution to applications that have a large number of passwords already stored and allows the developers to convert them to OAuth-friendly keys behind the scenes. Well, from what I gather, that was the intended purpose. However there are many mobile Twitter applications out there <em>only</em> are using xAuth. Why does this tick me off?</p>

<p>1) As a user, I’m still giving my password to the application. The application is not <em>supposed</em> to store the credentials, however this is un-enforceable. At this point I’m only safe-guarded against applications that have their passwords stolen. I won’t deny that’s an issue, but not enough to force all developers to go OAuth-only.</p>

<p>2) Even <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter’s official client</a> requires me to hand over my password. If Twitter is going to take the stance that all API usage is going to go through OAuth, I think they should eat their own dog food and redirect me to a mobile browser.</p>

<p>Do I dislike OAuth? Certainly not. And I know Twitter has some brilliant talent. But if Twitter is going to make OAuth vs Basic Auth this big of a priority, I think they are missing mark by moving a lot of applications to xAuth.</p>
