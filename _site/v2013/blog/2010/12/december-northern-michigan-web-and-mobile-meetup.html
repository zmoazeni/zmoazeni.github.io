    <p>Last night we had our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nmich-web-mobile/calendar/15499042/">December Michigan Web and Mobile Meetup</a>. We only had a couple guys due to family commitments, but that’s understandable since we’re only a week away from Christmas.</p>

<p>In the talk from <a href="/blog/2010/11/november-northern-michigan-web-and-mobile-meetup/">last month</a>, Gary Vaynerchuk mentioned Zappos and hearing about their rich company culture, we watched an interview by the CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh.</p>

<p>Before we watched the interview, we actually watched Jeff Bezos of Amazon give a short clip when they acquired Zappos:</p>

<p><a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/24384">Here’s Tony’s interview</a> on <a href="http://bigthink.com/">BigThink.com</a>.</p>

<p>Tony speaks a lot differently than Gary, but has a lot of insight on Business and Happiness. He mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996">Good to Great</a> and having read that a few years ago, I heartily recommend it as well. He also mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribal-Leadership-Leveraging-Thriving-Organization/dp/0061251305">Tribal Leadership</a> which I’ll be picking up soon. And of course there’s Tony’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446563048">Delivering Happiness</a> which I still need to check out.</p>

<p>I really appreciate Tony’s perspective on culture and happiness. I also connected with his comments about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y">Millennials</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…there are so many people in corporate America where they’re a different person at home on weekends versus on monday when they’re in the office. And they leave a little part of themselves, or a big part of themselves at home … maybe what the millennials are bringing to the forefront [is that] they can be the same person…</p>
