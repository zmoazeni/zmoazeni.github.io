    <p>A couple days ago I wrote an article about <a href="/2010/06/i-am-far-from-unemployed">perceptions I’ve encountered as a freelancer</a>. The article took off on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, which a great feeling.</p>

<p>I received several thousand page views in the process. At first I was like “Wow!” and that quickly turned into “Oh crap…” I wasn’t sure if my server hosting this blog would be able to handle that amount of traffic. But <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> handled it like a champ.</p>

<p>When I setup this blog, I found an excellent How-To article on setting up Wordpress on Nginx using FastCGI from <a href="http://elasticdog.com/2008/02/howto-install-wordpress-on-nginx/">Aaron Schaefer</a>. At the time this blog was using 5 PHP CGI processes and wasn’t using any form of Wordpress page caching, however neither memory nor CPU broke a sweat. And I’m only running on a few hundred MBs.</p>

<p>I don’t think Nginx is a perfect fit in every instance, however I’m really pleased with the results. I definitely recommend it to anyone else who is on the fence.</p>
