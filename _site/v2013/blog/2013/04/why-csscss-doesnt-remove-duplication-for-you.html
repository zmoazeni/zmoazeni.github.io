    <p>After I released <a href="http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/">csscss</a>, I’ve been asked numerous times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why doesn’t csscss remove duplication for me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a fair question. It is easy to look at csscss and ask why it
isn’t more like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming\)">minifier</a>
that a developer can just run before deploying updates. In fact
<a href="http://css.github.io/csso/">CSSO</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/begriffs/css-ratiocinator">css-ractionator</a> are
projects that do this exact thing.</p>

<p>So why didn’t I build it that way?</p>

<h2 id="csscss-forces-me-consider-my-code-design">csscss forces me consider my (code) design</h2>

<p>I built csscss as a tool to help a developer write smarter CSS.
Duplication isn’t all bad, but we often write duplicated CSS
unknowingly. When I see duplicated CSS, it forces me to think about my
rules and structure. It forces me to ask myself several questions about
my code.</p>

<p>“Is this necessary?”</p>

<p>“Have I already defined a structure for this? Do I need to extend
existing structures?”</p>

<p>“Is there a better way to define the same rules?”</p>

<p>“Can I leverage other CSS tools to better structure these styles?
(<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, etc)”</p>

<p>All of these answers reduce duplication, but more importantly, they
force me to consider the design of my code. And I don’t think there is a
single algorithm that satisfies all cases.</p>

<p>Now you can obviously do this without an automated tool. And it is easy
for a small number of rules. However as your site/application grows it is
extremely difficult to continue this mental juggling.</p>

<p>I like to think of csscss as a tool that helps <strong>extend my intuition</strong>,
not replace it.</p>

<h2 id="generated-code-is-harder-to-debug">Generated code is harder to debug</h2>

<p>If csscss generated new duplication-free code, all I am doing is punting
work for later. Which usually comes up when I need to debug my styles
from the browser. If the generated output is substantially different
than the original source, it makes my job harder to fix my problems.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a>,
though I still enjoy using it. The coffeescript I write and the
javascript I debug are different. Luckily, in that case I can follow the
flow enough to jump back to coffeescript to fix my bugs.</p>

<p>However the point of csscss is not to optimize code, it is to help
inform you about areas improvement. If csscss did this for you, I expect
the gulf between original source and browser CSS to be rather large.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-css-landscape">Improving the CSS landscape</h2>

<p>None of this is a knock against other developers working on the same
problem. In fact, I think different perspectives and trial/error in this
field can only be a good thing. CSS has been around for over a decade
and it is surprising to me that we don’t have more tools. So I commend
anyone spending time to contribute. csscss is my contribution based on
my opinions.</p>

<p>Here are some others tools that people have mentioned since I released
csscss.</p>
