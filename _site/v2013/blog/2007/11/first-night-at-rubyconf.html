    <p>Ok so not really. RubyConf officially starts tomorrow, but I still had a blast. The highlight of the night, other than meeting some rockstars in the Ruby community like Chad Fowler, Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Marcel Molina, was playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28game%29">Werewolf (also known as Mafia)</a>. Talk a complete mind-fuck.</p>

<p>What makes the game even more fun (or frustrating depending on your point of view) is playing with Software Developers. We work daily with logic, so there is so much back and forth as to who is a Werewolf and who is a Villager that its hilarious to keep tabs on who’s saying what, and the implications of what they said.</p>

<p>I’ve already met quite a few people here at the hotel. It’s so interesting to hear the background of some of the people attending the conference. From people writing Ruby to support the enterprise infrastructure of a TeleCo to a guy who’s working at Stanford researching DNA.</p>

<p>I’ve made up my mind to try extremely hard to stay at the hotel that a conference is given (as long as I don’t have to take out a second mortgage). It’s so easy to meet new people who are either speaking or just attending in the lobby.</p>
