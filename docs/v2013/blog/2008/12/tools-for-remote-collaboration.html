    <p>For those of you who don’t know, Janson works in Seattle while Aaron and I work in Holland MI. Even though he’s in Seattle, we’re still able to work as if he were in the office. We’ve had pretty good success with a few tools.</p>

<h3 id="skype-and-a-good-microphone">Skype and a good microphone</h3>

<p>Multiple times a day we call Janson on <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> via our badass <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/products/Snowball">Snowball</a>. This microphone rocks, and it’s fairly inexpensive (around $100). It works so well that Janson is able to listen to the music we have playing in the office.</p>

<p>Janson also picked up a <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/products/Snowflake">Snowflake</a> which has worked great.</p>

<p>I always thought video was key to remote collaborating, but I’ve totally changed my mind. Audio is the first step. Often Janson and I will be working for over an hour via Skype and it feels like the other person is right next to you.</p>

<h3 id="writeboard">Writeboard</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">Writeboards</a> are a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a> product that are like a versioned document. We use these frequently for asynchronous collaboration.</p>

<p>There are other alternatives to Writeboards, but we’ve found that their low barrier of entry and textile support has helped a lot.</p>

<h3 id="campfire">Campfire</h3>

<p>Another form of text communication we use regularly are <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire chat rooms</a>, another <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a> product. These have been really helpful from pasting code snipbits, uploading shared files and privacy/guest access.</p>

<p>All of us at <a href="http://elevatorup.com">Elevator Up</a> are very familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC</a>, and we may switch back to it someday, but Campfire gives us all the chat room features we need without hassle.</p>

<h3 id="etherpad">EtherPad</h3>

<p>Last Monday <a href="http://whycurious.tumblr.com/">Janson</a> came across <a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a> and oh boy it’s a gem.</p>

<p>When collaborating on a document we’ve been using a combination of Writeboards/Campfire chats. They do the job, but there’s a ton of “Okay, I saved. Reload.” or “Hrm, I’d rephrase it this way. Lemme copy/paste” which gets rather annoying.</p>

<p><a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a> on the other hand allows multiple people to be editing text at the same time. As far as I know, it’s very similar to <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> but through the browser instead of with a client. It’s helped us out tremendously especially when writing user stories.</p>

<p>EtherPad is in a closed beta, but they are pretty quick to grant beta access. We’ve only been using it for a week, and already consider it a part of our remote toolset.</p>

<h3 id="vpnsshscreenvim">VPN/SSH/Screen/Vim</h3>

<p>Both Janson and I code in Textmate, but we both came from Vim. We’ve toyed with using a VPN to SSH into the other’s machine. Connect to a shared Screen session and code in Vim for Paired Programming. As of yet, we’ve only done it a couple of times, and most of our issues are related to going back into the console for development.</p>

<p>We were both amazed at the responsiveness with a shared session, though thinking back on it, there’s very little traffic compared to other remote solutions. This is one of our rougher tools, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we make this a permanent addition.</p>

<h3 id="wheres-vnc">Where’s VNC?</h3>

<p>Surprisingly we don’t use VNC that often. Sometimes we use it when we need to present to a client who is also remote, but that’s fairly rare. We’ve also found using screen capturing software like <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">SnapX Pro</a> to do a better job when presenting remotely.</p>
