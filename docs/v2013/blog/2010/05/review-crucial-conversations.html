    <h1><cite>Review: Crucial Conversations</cite></h1>
    <time datetime="2010-05-17T21:55:08-04:00">17 May 2010</time>

    <p>Months ago I shared my difficulties with leading others and sharing opinions effectively with Josh Little from <a href="http://www.bloomfire.com/">Bloomfire</a>. He recommended I pick up the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071401946?tag=tibesti-20">Crucial Conversations</a> and even mentioned he has had to re-read it many times over the years. It was the first book I finished on my vacation, and I am very grateful for his recommendation.</p>

<p>After the first few pages, I was initially put off by the number of buzzwords and new vocabulary (e.g. “shared pool of meaning”). I often get turned off with authors who would rather invent vague terminology than give clear meaning. However despite the capitalization, I felt the book provided great insight.</p>

<p>Some especially key take-aways for me were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reaffirmation to first improve myself especially since it’s much easier than trying to change others.</li>
  <li>The differences between content and context. I certainly get bogged down with specifically what someone says rather than thinking about their frame of mind. Or what they’re not saying and merely hinting at.</li>
  <li>Highlighting the connection between open dialogue and a safe environment, with steps on helping set the context in a safe way.</li>
  <li>The differences between apologizing vs contrasting, and when apologizing is and isn’t appropriate. This book helped me realize that I’ve used apologizing as a social crutch rather than expressing regret over a transgression.</li>
  <li>I liked the authors opinion on attitude, and how someone else doesn’t change your attitude, you ultimately control your attitude and your actions that result from it.</li>
  <li>I think the authors did a great job emphasizing the scenarios of how conversations could be handled better. They didn’t just throw out their points for their readers to interpret alone.</li>
</ol>

<p>And for my biggest take-away: I appreciated that the book focused more on positive, open-minded dialogue and not subversive techniques to manipulate someone else. The points in the book were meant for the contentious and not for the silver-tongued. That just feels right to me.</p>

<p>So along with Josh, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. I feel it can help bridge communication break downs between couples and peers alike.</p>
