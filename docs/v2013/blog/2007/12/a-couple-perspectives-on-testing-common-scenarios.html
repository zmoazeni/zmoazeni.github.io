<p>Suppose we have a Rails ActiveRecord model for a book:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :title
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Some people suggest testing the validation of the title by just checking to see if either A) <code class="highlighter-rouge">validates_presence_of(:title)</code> was called or B) whatever the side effect of <code class="highlighter-rouge">validates_presence_of(:title)</code> is present in the object (e.g. creating a method, adding an object to an array of validators, etc.) I believe their objective is to both DRY up their tests as well as not worrying about testing <code class="highlighter-rouge">validates_presence_of</code>, since that should already be tested by the framework.</p>

<p>I tend to disagree with this approach, and would much rather we test the behavior of a book. Let’s instantiate a book without a title, and assert that it is in fact invalid.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># for test/unit
def test_books_should_require_titles
  book = Book.new(:title =&gt; nil)
  assert !book.valid?
  assert book.errors.on(:title)
end

# for rspec
describe Book do
  it "should require titles" do
book = Book.new(:title =&gt; nil)
book.should have(1).error_on(:title)
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While I do think the other approach is better than not testing at all, I believe testing the behavior in this case has a higher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>. In other words, I feel that divorcing the test from the particular implementation will make our test more robust than the former. The prime example I can see for this scenario is that testing the behavior will encompass both using <code class="highlighter-rouge">validates_presence_of</code> and any other form (in case our implementation is a bit more complex).</p>

<p>I can respect trying to DRY up the tests and not wanting to duplicate it for every attribute. For that I would suggest creating a helper that tests a series of attributes for you. Something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe Book do
  should_require(:title, :author, :published_at, :copyrighted_at)
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="backpedaling-a-little">Backpedaling a little</h3>

<p>I actually use the first approach often when I’m testing my controllers. Usually when I want to focus on a testing an action in my controller, and I want to test it in isolation. However I do want to assert that a filter is assigned to that controller.</p>

<p>Suppose we had a controller for library on a college campus that only allowed Students and Faculty in:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class LibraryController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_filter :requires_students_or_faculty

  def checkout
... implementation of the action ...
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>First I would assert that the library checks people, but I don’t want to worry about it when I want to test <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkout</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># Staying with RSpec
describe LibraryController, "filters" do
  should_have_before_filter(:requires_students_or_faculty)
end

describe LibraryController, "something to do with checkout" do
  stub_all_filters!

  it "should redirect the patron outside after checking out a book" do
... implementation of the test ...
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Minor Note - <code class="highlighter-rouge">stub_all_filters!</code> runs through all filters and stubs them out so they all return <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>, making them irrelevant.</p>

<p>I’m not doing this in order to remove the responsibility of testing the the filter itself. I whole heartedly believe it should be tested too, but separating the tests can help avoid clunky tests with a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it, is to consider this perspective of “behavior”. While I do agree that the filters contribute to the overall behavior of a controller, when I want to test a specific behavior (in this case, <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkout</code>), I don’t want my tests to have to satisfy preconditions <code class="highlighter-rouge">requires_students_or_faculty</code>. For example, checking if a user is a student or faculty could be complex, and there’s no reason to care about that when testing <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkout</code></p>
