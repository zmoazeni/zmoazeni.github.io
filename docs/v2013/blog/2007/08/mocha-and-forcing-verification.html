    <h1><cite>Mocha and Forcing Verification</cite></h1>
    <time datetime="2007-08-02T22:26:18-04:00">02 August 2007</time>

    <p>I switched to <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org">Mocha</a> about 5 months ago, and after getting over my preference for strict ordering, really enjoyed the library.</p>

<p>One problem I continue to have with the library is the silent failure of mocks if an assertion fails prior to the verification.</p>

<p>Looking at the code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Car
  def initialize(parts = [])
@parts = parts
  end

  def start
started = true
@parts.each do | part |
  # commenting out for failure
  # started = started &amp;&amp; part.start
end

started
  end

end

class SomeTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_start
engine_mock = mock("engine_mock")
car = Car.new([engine_mock])

engine_mock.expects(:start).returns(false)
assert !car.start
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I am left with a failing test that only provides information regarding the assertion failing. Now with this trivial case, I can look into the method to discover where my problem is, but generally I have to resort to inserting logging in order to discover the crux of my problem.</p>

<p>What I have typically done is in every TestCase I write is include a common teardown</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def teardown
  mocha_verify
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will still error, but it will provide information about the mock failing as well as the assertion failing, which generally provides me quicker turn around in grokking why the test is failing in the first place. The only thing I don’t like about this method, is that when you have a mock verification failure but all your assertions pass, you end up having duplicate Errors in the log. But I’m practical, and willing to live with that.</p>

<p>Getting tired of constantly having a common <code class="highlighter-rouge">teardown</code> in each test, I decided to crack open the hood of the library, and submit a patch<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. (Patches always seem to be the best conversation starter in open source projects.) However talking with <a href="http://blog.floehopper.org/">James Mead</a> we seem to have a different points of view in terms of fast failing of the tests.</p>

<p>I respect the choice to not include the functionality into the core, but until I am convinced otherwise, I need more information from my tests. If your brain works anything like mine (which may be an insult), you can use this snipit of code to monkey patch your TestCases to force the verification, and still ensure the execution of your teardown code.</p>

<p>I must put up some disclaimers, I did <strong>NOT</strong> engineer this code, and I take no credit for the elegance in providing a AOP-like advice. This was completely ripped off from <a href="http://hardmock.rubyforge.org/">Hardmock</a> written by the solid developers at <a href="http://atomicobject.com/">Atomic Object</a></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>require "mocha"
require "test/unit"

class Test::Unit::TestCase

  def mocha_force_verify
mocha_verify
  end

  if method_defined?(:teardown) then
alias_method :old_teardown, :teardown
define_method(:new_teardown) do
  begin
    mocha_force_verify
  ensure
    old_teardown
  end
end
  else
define_method(:new_teardown) do
  mocha_force_verify
end
  end
  alias_method :teardown, :new_teardown

  def self.method_added(method) #:nodoc:
case method
when :teardown
  unless method_defined?(:user_teardown)
    alias_method :user_teardown, :teardown
    define_method(:teardown) do
      begin
	new_teardown
      ensure
	user_teardown
      end
    end
  end
end
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Toss this bit of a code into a file and include it. This still has problems with the duplicate errors, but at least you don’t have to remember to implement each test’s teardown.</p>

<div id="fn1">
  I do have to commend all the maintainers of Mocha for a quality job in the library and the supporting test suites.
</div>

<h3 id="update-81007">Update 8/10/07</h3>

<p>I noticed a problem using this with rails 1.2.2 fixtures. Since both seem to use the same methodology. I’ll try and provide an updated snipbit soon.</p>

<h3 id="update-81207">Update 8/12/07</h3>

<p>After banging my head trying to have both the Fixtures source and my code to sit on top of <code class="highlighter-rouge">method_added</code>, I decided to just monkey patch mocha. Just plop this into a file and require it before your test.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'mocha'
require 'mocha/expectation_error'

module Mocha
  module ForceVerifyTestCaseAdapter
def self.included(base)
  base.class_eval do

    def run(result)
      yield(Test::Unit::TestCase::STARTED, name)
      @_result = result
      begin
	mocha_setup
	begin
	  setup
	  __send__(@method_name)
	  mocha_verify { add_assertion }
	rescue Mocha::ExpectationError =&gt; e
	  added_mocha_failure = true
	  add_failure(e.message, e.backtrace)
	rescue Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError =&gt; e
	  add_failure(e.message, e.backtrace)
	rescue StandardError, ScriptError
	  add_error($!)
	ensure
	  begin
	    teardown
	  rescue Test::Unit::AssertionFailedError =&gt; e
	    add_failure(e.message, e.backtrace)
	  rescue StandardError, ScriptError
	    add_error($!)
	  end
	end
      ensure
	unless added_mocha_failure
	  begin
	    mocha_verify
	  rescue
	    add_error($!)
	  end
	end
	mocha_teardown
      end
      result.add_run
      yield(Test::Unit::TestCase::FINISHED, name)
    end

  end
end
  end
end

class Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Mocha::ForceVerifyTestCaseAdapter
end
