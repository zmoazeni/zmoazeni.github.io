Most ruby developers who use mock libraries are familiar with either [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) or [Flex Mock](http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock/). However not many are familiar with the mock library that I use, [Hardmock](http://hardmock.rubyforge.org/).

Hardmock takes mocking one step further to assert order between mocks, much like the Java mocking library [EasyMock](http://www.easymock.org/)

    class Person
      def initialize(car, wallet)
	@car = car
	@wallet = wallet
      end

      def go_to_movies
	@car.drive_to_movies
	@wallet.pay_for_ticket("10.00")
	@car.drive_home
      end
    end

    ...

    # in tests
    def setup
      create_mocks :car_mock, :wallet_mock
      @person = Person.new(@car_mock, @wallet_mock)
    end

    # This test will pass
    def test_go_to_movies
      @car_mock.expects.drive_to_movies
      @wallet_mock.expects.pay_for_ticket("10.00")
      @car_mock.expects.drive_home

      @person.go_to_movies
    end

    # This test will fail since we
    # drive home before we paid for the ticket
    def test_go_to_movies_failure
      @car_mock.expects.drive_to_movies
      @car_mock.expects.drive_home
      @wallet_mock.expects.pay_for_ticket("10.00")

      @person.go_to_movies
    end

Another one of my favorite perks of Hardmock is the open assertions of parameters. For the most part, parameters are expected to equal what is given in the initial assertions, however sometimes there's complications on asserting the parameters given.

    def test_allow_any_money_for_ticket
      @car_mock.expects.drive_to_movies
      @wallet_mock.expects.pay_for_ticket do | amount |
	# this will be executed when "pay_for_ticket" is called on the mock

	# Only allow dollar amounts
	assert_match(/^\d+\.\d{2}$/, amount)

	# of course the last value in this block
	# with be returned from the mock to the caller
	"the ticket"
      end
      @car_mock.expects.drive_home

      @person.go_to_movies
    end
