For the past few months I've been helping [Nicholas Patten](http://twitter.com/#!/nicholaspatten) take his vision and translate it into an iPad App. I'm proud to announce [Spatik](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spatik/id411006823?mt=8) was accepted today and is now available in the App Store.

It's purpose is to bring Google Reader and Twitter to a user's fingertips (literally) and let the users schedule tweets. Spatik was a lot of fun to work on for me for a variety of reasons. While developing Spatik I learned more about:

* Google's OAuth workflow, I had previously worked on Twitter OAuth on other projects.
* The OAuth workflow within the iOS environment.
* Having an iOS client interact with a custom backend server.
* The App Store approval process.
* The iOS human user interface guidelines and building custom interface components.

I will post more about the development lessons learned in other posts. But right now, I want the spotlight squarely on [Spatik](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spatik/id411006823?mt=8) and [Nicholas Patten](http://twitter.com/#!/nicholaspatten).

Check out the app, give it a spin!
