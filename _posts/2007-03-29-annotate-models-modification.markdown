[annotate_models](http://svn.pragprog.com/Public/plugins/annotate_models) has been really useful for me. However when using [fixture_groups](/2007/3/29/fixture-groups) fixtures in subfolders are ignored. I modified the plugin slightly to include them. With luck these changes can be merged with [Dave Thomas's version](http://pragdave.pragprog.com).

Until then, here it is: [annotate_models](http://source.elevatorfight.com/public/annotate_models)


    ./script/plugin install \
