For those of you who don't know, Janson works in Seattle while Aaron and I work in Holland MI. Even though he's in Seattle, we're still able to work as if he were in the office. We've had pretty good success with a few tools.

### Skype and a good microphone

Multiple times a day we call Janson on [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) via our badass [Snowball](http://www.bluemic.com/products/Snowball). This microphone rocks, and it's fairly inexpensive (around $100). It works so well that Janson is able to listen to the music we have playing in the office.

Janson also picked up a [Snowflake](http://www.bluemic.com/products/Snowflake) which has worked great.

I always thought video was key to remote collaborating, but I've totally changed my mind. Audio is the first step. Often Janson and I will be working for over an hour via Skype and it feels like the other person is right next to you.

### Writeboard

[Writeboards](http://www.writeboard.com/) are a [37Signals](http://www.37signals.com/) product that are like a versioned document. We use these frequently for asynchronous collaboration.

There are other alternatives to Writeboards, but we've found that their low barrier of entry and textile support has helped a lot.

### Campfire

Another form of text communication we use regularly are [Campfire chat rooms](http://www.campfirenow.com/), another [37Signals](http://www.37signals.com/) product. These have been really helpful from pasting code snipbits, uploading shared files and privacy/guest access.

All of us at [Elevator Up](http://elevatorup.com) are very familiar with [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc), and we may switch back to it someday, but Campfire gives us all the chat room features we need without hassle.

### EtherPad

Last Monday [Janson](http://whycurious.tumblr.com/) came across [EtherPad](http://etherpad.com/) and oh boy it's a gem.

When collaborating on a document we've been using a combination of Writeboards/Campfire chats. They do the job, but there's a ton of "Okay, I saved. Reload." or "Hrm, I'd rephrase it this way. Lemme copy/paste" which gets rather annoying.

[EtherPad](http://etherpad.com/) on the other hand allows multiple people to be editing text at the same time. As far as I know, it's very similar to [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) but through the browser instead of with a client. It's helped us out tremendously especially when writing user stories.

EtherPad is in a closed beta, but they are pretty quick to grant beta access. We've only been using it for a week, and already consider it a part of our remote toolset.

### VPN/SSH/Screen/Vim

Both Janson and I code in Textmate, but we both came from Vim. We've toyed with using a VPN to SSH into the other's machine. Connect to a shared Screen session and code in Vim for Paired Programming. As of yet, we've only done it a couple of times, and most of our issues are related to going back into the console for development.

We were both amazed at the responsiveness with a shared session, though thinking back on it, there's very little traffic compared to other remote solutions. This is one of our rougher tools, but I wouldn't be surprised if we make this a permanent addition.

### Where's VNC?

Surprisingly we don't use VNC that often. Sometimes we use it when we need to present to a client who is also remote, but that's fairly rare. We've also found using screen capturing software like [SnapX Pro](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/) to do a better job when presenting remotely.
