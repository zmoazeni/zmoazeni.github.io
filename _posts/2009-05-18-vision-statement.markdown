For a while I've wrestled with the direction I want my life to take. After listening to advice of people much more seasoned than me, I decided to organize my thoughts. And that's a very difficult and time consuming task for me.

I initially set out to write my mission statement, but after I kept writing, it really felt more of a vision statement. I'm not one to argue the semantics between the two, but calling it a "vision statement" feels more appropriate.

I've uploaded the [latest revision of my vision statement](/vision-statement) and I'd welcome feedback either below or via email at zach -dot- moazeni -at- gmail -dot- com.
