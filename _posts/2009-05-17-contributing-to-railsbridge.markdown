## Need Code Help?

I'm really excited about the possibilities around [RailBridge](http://railsbridge.org/). As a seasoned Ruby developer I will be offering code reviews on Rails and non-Rails code alike.

Steps to ask for help are pretty easy.

1. Create a [Github Gist](http://gist.github.com) with the code you want to go over.
1. Ping either [RailsBridge](http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge), or ping me through [Twitter](http://twitter.com/zmoazeni) with the URL to the Gist and your contact information.
1. Let's chat!

## Universities and Colleges in the Michigan Area

If your Computer Science department wants seasoned Ruby/Rails developers to speak with your students or wants to offer RailsBridge community support to your students. Send me an email at zach -dot- moazeni -at- gmail -dot- com, I'd love to speak with you.
