  a CSS redundancy analyzer that analyzes redundancy.
---

About eight months ago, I had an idea for a potential tool that could
help refactor
[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets).
I wondered, "Why aren't there many (any?) CSS static code analyzers
out there?"

I mean when you think about it, it is a little crazy. CSS is a pretty
simple language and it has been around for over 15 years. The
[selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors)
can get a little intense and there is a laundry list of properties. But
the core syntax of CSS is pretty straightforward.

The premise was simple. In all other languages, I work at writing
[DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) code. So why
can't something inform me when I'm repeating the same declarations over
and over? Better yet, I wouldn't need a browser to figure this out. I
should have all information immediately available in the source code.

I had this idea eight months ago, and I am proud that I had the
fortitude to stick with the project and launch it. So here it is.

World, please meet [csscss](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/).
