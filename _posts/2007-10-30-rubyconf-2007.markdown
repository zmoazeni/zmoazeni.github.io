I'm really geeked to go to RubyConf this year. A very needed get-away from the hubbub around the office. As a typical dork, I went ahead and threw RubyConf's schedule in ["iCal and exported it"](/assets/2007/10/31/RubyConf.ics) in case anyone else needs it.

If you're planning on attending RubyConf send me an email, and perhaps we can chat over a beer.
