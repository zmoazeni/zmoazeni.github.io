Last Thursday we had our first [Northern Michigan Web and Mobile Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nmich-web-mobile/) meeting. While eating pizza, we watched [an interview with Jason Fried](http://bigthink.com/ideas/18516) and discussed it afterwards.

I had a pretty good time, and received some nice compliments on the format. Talking with the group, we may continue to watch and discuss interviews. I've set a date for the [next meetup on November 18th](http://www.meetup.com/nmich-web-mobile/calendar/15107332/). I'm still considering where we should go for the venue. CityMac was accommodating, but a few mentioned the meeting rooms in the Library.

If you're in the Traverse City area on the 18th, I encourage you to drop by!
