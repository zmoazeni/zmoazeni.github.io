At Elevator Up, Aaron and I frequently work at Cafes like [JPs Coffee](http://jpscoffee.com). But [Panera Bread](http://www.panerabread.com) is quickly becoming my favorite place to work.

They have such a laid back atmosphere with excellent service, great food at a low price. And as if that wasn't all, every one I've been at has provided free WiFi. They even have signs advertising power outlets in the building.

Truly a perfect place for a developer to focus for a few hours.
