Michelle Greer [recently wrote about viscous online comments on TechCrunch](http://www.michellesblog.net/blogs/my-challenge-to-michael-arrington-techcrunch-hint-its-not-hard). Unfortunately, over the years I've seen a few ugly incidents where a female was singled out online and verbally attacked. To me, there is one thing worse than these gut-less commenters: it's telling a minority to "suck it up" or "don't take it personal" or "that's just the way it is" or "quit whining".

If you're someone who tells a minority to ignore abuse, you need to seriously reconsider your position. Because it is sickening.
