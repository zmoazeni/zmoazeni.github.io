> "Finally, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much value in arguing over who has the most incentive to create good products. The point is you&rsquo;ll be better off in the long-term if you delivery high-value high-quality products, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re a consultancy, startup, or enterprise shop."
