Yesterday we brought home our newest addition to the Moazeni household. Meet our new Great Dane. Brutus:

He's been quite the handful, and boy is he scrappy. He does not have any qualms about showing off his puppy bark. His first encounter with Mocha he gave her a few tiny growls and barks and now she steers clear of him.

So if see this little Harlequin on the street, watch out. He'll give you a piece of his mind. Just ask his chew toys and my socks.
