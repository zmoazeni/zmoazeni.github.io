So I've been itching for a Ruby Hacking Nite for a while. Elevator Up's going to host a night at our [offices](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=201+E+Washington+Ave,+Zeeland,+MI+49464&sll=43.416605,-85.582686&sspn=0.007871,0.017037&ie=UTF8&ll=42.813993,-86.014001&spn=0.007949,0.017037&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1) on Tues the 22nd starting around 6ish, where we'll supply some Pizza, Brew and Dew.

We'll toss up a few ideas and then just choose something that seems interesting to work on. Don't feel intimidated if you're not pure awesomeness with the language. But I do suggest you know the basics.

### A Few Ideas

* I've had a hankering for an online play by twitter / email / etc [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29) game
* A blog / twitter/ tumblr aggregator with links back to their originating sites.
* A few people on the GR Ruby group had a few ideas dealing with RSS feeds

### My Goals

* Chat with some interesting people while working on a few interesting problems.
* Learn from other's coding styles, and problem solving techniques.
* Pass on a few things I've picked up while coding.
* Lastly, perhaps we can finish a few projects that we all have on our laundry list of "Crap to Code up"
