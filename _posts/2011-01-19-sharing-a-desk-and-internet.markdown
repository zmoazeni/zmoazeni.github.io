  When I leased an office in Elk Rapids, I opened it up for traveling
  coworkers.

After two months in the new office, I realized we're going to need to a lot more stuff to fill up the space: couch, big screen, etc. You know, the essentials?

Then I realized I could just bring in a new desk and offer up the space/internet for people who are passing through. Especially, since there are no [coworking spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) in Traverse City.

So if you're in or around [Traverse City](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Traverse+City,+MI&aq=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=47.033113,68.291016&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Traverse+City,+Grand+Traverse,+Michigan&z=13) / [Elk Rapids](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Elk+Rapids,+MI&sll=44.763057,-85.620632&sspn=0.082881,0.133381&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Elk+Rapids,+Antrim,+Michigan&z=14), feel free to stop by. I do ask that you sign in through [DesksNearMe](http://desksnear.me/workplaces/497-connection-required) beforehand so we don't overcommit the space.
