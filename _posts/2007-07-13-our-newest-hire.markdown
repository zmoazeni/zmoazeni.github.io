Aaron and I have been talking a lot the past couple weeks about the overwhelming about of work we have at Elevator Up. It really is a good thing, and I'm not complaining at all. Busy startups are longer lived startups.

We're still keeping our eye out for good design work, but we noticed our greatest need was in production as well as alleviating Aaron with some of his non-code stresses.

So everyone, give welcome to Janson Hartliep, our newest hire. I feel like he's going to be a great fit for team and hopefully soon he can help me crank out some of our longest running projects like [Eventable](http://www.eventable.com).
