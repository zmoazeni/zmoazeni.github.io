  content: ! '<p>Well done man! Keep your eye on the ball! I have been freelancing
    for over 8 years now, and I will never go back. Telecommuting is as common as
    office politics, and 90% of the companies out there accept it. You will be just
    fine, just one rule of thumb to live by: "Perception IS reality" when it comes
    to working with customers. If they perceive you as too busy, then that is what
    you are. ALWAYS answer emails/phone/texts PROMPTLY...even if it is to say: "At
    lunch right now, but when I get back to my desk I will get that information for
    you" </p>


    <p>Have fun, and welcome to the world of freelancing!

    Patrick</p>

  content: ! '<p>I know exactly this feeling. I''m a rising college junior, and the
    past few summers I''ve done research at a university near my home. This year I
    chose to write my own iPhone/Android app instead, and when I tell people their
    faces go a bit blank as they try to decide whether to console me for not being
    able to get a real job or to smile and say "Oh, that''s great" like they''re used
    to.</p>


    <p>Going independent seems almost like a blemish, as if you are only reduced to
    it because of some failing elsewhere in life. I wonder if I told people I was
    forming a start-up to build iPhone apps without explaining that it was only me,
    I would regain a little of my lost credibility.</p>

  content: ! '<p>I never experienced what you''re talking about, Zach. People have
    generally been, what I perceived as, "impressed".  Just a guess, but perhaps it''s
    my use of (or lack there of) the words "freelance" or "independent". I tell people
    I''m a "small business owner", or "run a micro-consulting firm" (as in a small
    "firm of one"). </p>


    <p>For me. phrases like "going independent" always made me think of my friends
    and family that talked about selling Amway (not that there''s anything wrong with
    that). :)</p>


    <p>Alternately, perhaps it was more about when I made the shift (just about 9
    years ago now).</p>

    <p>Not sure I''d agree with that.  Depends on definitions I suppose, but the majority
    of companies I talk to - the ones who often <em>want</em> me to work with them
    - will not allow telecommuting.</p>

  content: ! '<p>@Kevin, @Fred - Thanks for helping represent W. Mich :)</p>


    <p>@Patrick - I appreciate your advice on responding promptly. I''ve always felt
    that, but reading your comment was a kick in my pants to respond to a few emails
    I had in my "Reply Today" folder.</p>


    <p>@Alex - That''s awesome man! You have a huge leg up on me. When I was in college
    I followed the "corporate path", and it took years to unlearn that mentality.
    Also regarding credibility, as weird as this sounds I''m a big believer that your
    work and your results builds the credibility. Not other people''s opinions. Do
    what you think is right and adjust based on the results and the right kind of
    credibility will follow.</p>


    <p>@Brian - Eh, I''d rather say I''m "independent" or "freelancing" rather than
    "small business owner". But to each his own.</p>


    <p>@Raphael - Yeah, I''ve gotten that a lot too. It''s hard to describe to others
    the difficulties that come with working from home.</p>


    <p>@Patrick, @Michael - I don''t think it''s about % of companies out there, I
    think it is more what kind of companies/projects/teams you''re marketing yourself
    too and how well you do communicating remotely. Which is distinctly different
    than communicating in person.</p>

  content: ! '<p>Congratulations! It''s a big step. I''ve done the same thing recently
    (though am not freelancing). Don''t have a good word to explain it yet, I normally
    just say I''m "doing my own thing" or "working for myself". I often get the same
    initial reactions, but most people "get it" eventually. I wrote about it here:

Monday was the beginning of my third week working independent. And these three weeks have been a lot of fun. Very busy, but fun. However one thing that surprised me was the reaction from others when they asked what I do for a living.

The most typical reaction I have been getting from local friends and acquaintances who are full time employees is sympathy. Phrases like "Well you gotta do what you gotta do." or "Things will turn around, the economy is improving."

No no **NO!**

I _chose_ this path. I wasn't forced to go independent as a result of a layoff or the inability to find full time employment. I love what I do and I love that I am able to help other businesses who need my skills and experience.

This reminds me of a blog post a friend shared years ago, that has now been lost, which described an Entrepreneur's move from the Midwest to the West Coast. He too was taken back at the differences in reactions. Generally a Midwest-ern would say something out of pity or look at him as if he were jobless. While the people he talked to in the West Coast would get excited and share their own dreams of starting something new.

I am far from unemployed and so are the plethora of other software freelancers out there. Sure we may have downtime, but that is just one part of our world. So the next time you are talking to someone who mentions they are independent, and you feel sorry for them, mentally check yourself. If you like the guy or gal, ask for their business card and pass it to someone you think would need their services or tweet/blog about the great interaction you had with them. 

I appreciate that way more than sympathetic encouragement.
