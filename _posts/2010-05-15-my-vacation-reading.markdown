Every time I go on an extended vacation I end up ripping through a half dozen books. It's probably because of a need to catch up on long overdue reading. Though I have noticed that it mentally refreshes me much more than watching episodes of [LOST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)).

Here was this vacation's reading list. I'm planning on writing up my summary for each of the books which were all good in their own way.

<a href="/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0489.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0489.jpg" alt="Crucial Confrontations, Book Yourself Solid, The Go-Giver, The Little Gold Book of Yes! Attitude, The Little Red Book of Selling" title="Vacation Reading List" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291" /></a>
