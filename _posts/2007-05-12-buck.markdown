So we bought a 2nd Great Dane, as if [Brutus](/2007/5/brutus) wasn't enough of a handful.

Meet Buck: ![Buck](/assets/2007/5/12/brutus1.png "Buck")

We called the Breeder for Brutus's papers, and while she was on the phone we asked about one of his brothers who had injured his leg when he was a few weeks old. She said that someone had brought him home, but then decided to return him.

So going against my better judgment we decided to give this poor pup a good home. Boy these two are going to be huge.
