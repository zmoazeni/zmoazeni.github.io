Over the past few months, I have been working with [Downstream](http://downstreamapp.com) on one of their products [Tweetstream](http://tweetstreamapp.com). In addition to building features, we have experienced a significant issue with the infrastructure.

Last night we pushed live a slew of updates and as a result the application is much speedier. The guys were so thrilled with the result that they wanted me to write a geeky technical post about all the changes for their users. You can read the entire article [on their blog](http://blog.downstreamapp.com/post/2418156381/tweetstream-is-now-web-scale) and also discuss it on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2032126)
