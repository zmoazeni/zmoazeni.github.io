I've been so busy with work that I didn't get to post how the [Hacking session](/2008/1/hacking-nite) went. 2 weeks ago we met at the Elevator Up office and worked on a [Kayak](http://www.kayak.com/) api [Brandon Keepers](http://opensoul.org/) had started earlier. We also used [iui](http://code.google.com/p/iui/) to allow searching from an iPhone.

I created a [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/grhack) so we could coordinate for the next session.
