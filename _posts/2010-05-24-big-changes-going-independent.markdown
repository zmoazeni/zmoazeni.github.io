## What's the news? ##

Starting this week, I'm putting out my shingle ... I'm going independent ... and I'm praying I won't starve.

I feel blessed with the opportunities I've encountered along my journey, and lately I have had a strong urge to strike out on my own. I want to experience what it's like to be an independent business owner, and I am excited for the opportunity to work with extremely smart developers as I continue this path.

I'm also curious if I will come to love this new freedom or if I'll hang myself with it.

## But why are you leaving Elevator Up? ##

Elevator Up has been such a great experience. Both Aaron and Dayna are great guys and they truly care about both their employees and their clients.

One thing I really appreciate about my experience at Elevator Up has been my exposure to many different communities and business models. Even though I'm going independent, I don't feel like I'm leaving Elevator Up, but instead that I'm staying focused on the development community to which I feel the most attached.

This transition allows me to stay specialized in the my sphere while at the same time still being able to work with the gang at Elevator Up in areas where my strengths shine. It also allows me to engage with clients that may not have originally been a good fit for Elevator Up, but then allow me to bring Elevator Up into the conversation as they grow.

Aaron once said the phrase "Just because you work independent, doesn't meant you work alone" and I'm pumped that I am continuing my relationship with Elevator Up, but in just a different light.

## Ok, what do you _really_ think about Elevator Up? ##

Just that, Elevator Up is a great place to work and a great family. I think the people who know me best know that I'm too honest to say it any other way. And frankly, I don't have the energy to put up a false ruse.

I'm excited for this next adventure, and I'm grateful for the support of my Wife, my friends, and especially my family at Elevator Up.

If you want to talk more about my transition or have any Ruby/Rails projects feel free to [read about my experience](/about) and send me an email at zach -dot- moazeni -at- gmail -dot- com.
