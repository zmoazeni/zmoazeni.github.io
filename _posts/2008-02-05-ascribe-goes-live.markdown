We have been busting ass for over 2 solid months and last night we launched a new application. Check out [Ascribe](http://www.ascribehq.com/), a great portfolio management system specifically designed for contractors.

If you have any questions feel free to contact [Jason Carpenter](http://www.ascribehq.com/is/listening).
