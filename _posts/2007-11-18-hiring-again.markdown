It seems like it was just yesterday that we brought on [Janson](/2007/7/our-newest-hire). We're swamped with work, and luckily it's the kind we don't want to turn away. However we really need to bring on a few more people.

Aaron just posted a description on his [blog](http://www.theparagon.org/archives/2007/11/17/hiring_organized_people) and also on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&jobId=431549).

Based on our confirmed work, don't be surprised if we create another for a Ruby developer soon.
