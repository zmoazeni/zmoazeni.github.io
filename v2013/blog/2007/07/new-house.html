    <p>I’ve been rather quiet the past few weeks due to Brittany and I buying our first house. After 3 years of renting, we felt we were finally stable enough to make a commitment with our own home.</p>

<p>We purchased our brand new house in Howard City, MI. Everyone I talk to gives me this pained “I’m sorry about your commute” look, and no one seems to believe me that, it’s really not that bad.</p>

<p>Sure gas prices are a pain in the ass, but it’s actually nice to have an hour to sit and stew over what I need to do that day, or what I did that afternoon.</p>

<p>I’m rather lucky since we live only 5 minutes from the interstate, so it’s pretty much smooth sailing. But with the number of Orange Barrels I pass everyday, it feels like this month all of Michigan road construction decided to focus on Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>Hopefully soon I’ll post some pictures of our new home, and the area.</p>
