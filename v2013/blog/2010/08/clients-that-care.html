    <p>Whenever a client hires me, I make it a very specific point not to bring baggage to the table. Whether it’s other project scheduling issues, family schedules, strong toolset opinions, or any other demands on a freelancer’s time or mental-space. Some clients will gracefully deal with a freelancer’s baggage, but I’ve found that most clients would rather not have to concern themselves with it. As a result I work hard to guard my clients from that stress.</p>

<p>However, some baggage does inevitably come through. During the middle of July, we had a family emergency and I needed to immediately take off a couple weeks. Keep in mind two of the projects I was on were planning on launching at the end of July. So going offline that abruptly was a significant disruption.</p>

<p>I talked with each of my clients individually and I was relieved that they all took it well. After my first week out though, I was shocked at how thoughtful some of the emails/IMs/and Phone calls were. Here are a few snippets that I received:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Just wanted to check in and make sure you were doing ok. Again, let us know if there’s anything we can do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Obviously, do what you need to do for yourself. If that’s work I’ll be happy to keep you busy… We’d like to send some flowers…” (In response to me mentioning I may work on a feature to keep my mind busy)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Take care and as much time as you need.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Please take the time you need.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nothing comes before family. Take your time, when you’re ready to start back up just let me know. No rush.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve come to appreciate that my ideal client is not just a cool project nor a large budget, but instead a rich relationship. I feel very blessed that all of my clients are so considerate because there are many others out there who aren’t.</p>

<p>Thank you Mike, Dana, Orlando, McHughson, Daniel, and Nicholas.</p>
